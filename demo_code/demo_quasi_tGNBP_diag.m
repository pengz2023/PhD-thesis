% 5. Use 50% credible interval for variable selection

% Note that zero pattern matrix isZero could be asymmetric; 
isZero = quasiGNBP_C_percen(:,:,1)<0 & quasiGNBP_C_percen(:,:,2)>0; 
% If the 50% posterior credible interval for C(i,j) or C(j,i) contains zero, the corresponding 
% element is considered to be zero. In this way, the reuslting zero pattern of C could be asymmetric; 
% According to Zhang et al. (2022), C(i,j) is considered as nonzero if either C(i,j) or C(j,i) 
% is nonzero. In other words, C(i,j) is considered as zero iff both C(i,j) and C(j,i) is zero. 
quasiGNBP_C_NonZero = ~((isZero + isZero')==2);
diag(quasiGNBP_C_NonZero) = 1;
result = quasiGNBP_C_NonZero;

% Number of nonzeros in the upper/lower diagonal elements of precision matrix 
num_nonzero = (sum(result,'all')-p)/2 
% Sparsity level

% 6. Store adjacency matrix for drawing the network
path_0 = './adjacenyMatrix/';
FileName_3 = [path_0,'quasi_tGNBP_diag_adjacenyMatrix.csv'];
writematrix(result,FileName_3);
